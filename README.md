# Dev Update
Audio pass
- Added audio zones (reverb for chasm/inside areas)
- Added ambient wind/bird sounds
- Added triggers for passing through foliage to play random bits of foley
- Added audio triggers to change footstep sounds based on what the player is currently standing on

The foley on foliage I added is sourced from the web, fairly low quality, had to match the levels in audacity, but still not quite happy with how they sound, will find or record new foley if I have time, otherwise might just cut it for now.

Bug fix
Fixed various materials that were rendering still and ignoring vertex offsets from wind

# Development screens

Audio! It really adds a lot to the overall feel, even with just a base pass.
