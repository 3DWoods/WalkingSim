# Day 11-17
A long time has passed since my last commit working on this project, the semester has restarted and I'm back in classes. The last week or so of work as been spent on technical elements of the project, material, shaders, lighting, post-processing, and it's all taken up a lot of time with no real forward momentem on the project from a visual perspective. This weekend though involved a lot more doing on the visuals, crafting new areas and fleshing them out, trying new materials in the scene and working to find the feel of the lighting throughout the environment. Work should be smoother now I've gotten these kinks in the project sorted, and now it should just be straight forward environment design, focusing on elements that really bring out the feel I'm going for, but more on that as it develops. Here's some WIP screens featuring new lighting and materials.

TODO: Find a LUT Solution - the one I'm using I sourced from the internet (cannot find the source now) but it fails to compile a build, and only works in editor. Unless I'm missing something, Unity 2018's post processing stack does not come with a built in LUT component?

# Development screens

New materials using tesselation and displacement maps, volumetric lighting and color grading

Entrance section has been fleshed out more, adding some story telling elements in terms of the signage to ground the environment more as a believable space.
