# Day 4
Pushing through major art block, worked on more of the greyboxing and shaping of terrain, reworked some areas and added some varianting paths which include new climbable areas that give higher views of path areas.
My progress on modelling out the terrain has been iterative, trial and error, moving from Blender to Unity to check scale and flow of the paths that are emerging through my hand made terrain.

Originally I tried to use terrain generation tools, but found them too restrictive and opted to model the entire thing by hand, this is by far a much more time consuming process, and involves a lot more mental walls as I work through it, but ultimately I am happier with how it's shaping, and the level of control I have working inside Blender.
I'm still pushing in 3D assets such as cliff formations and other groups of rocks to get a general feel of scale/look, but as of yet I'm not focusing too hard on other assets, they are more placeholder or tests for key-focal points I am aiming for.
