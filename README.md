# Day 8
Around 75% done with the environment modelling, cabin/housing area needs to be started and the paths need to be tweaked, but it's turning out how I expected, which is a huge relief. Hopefully this will be done by day 9, 10 at the latest.
Added some additional backdrop mountains which help fill out the surrounding space, this helps a lot when the player is higher up and can see over the main walkable area to add further depth to the world.

Additionally, quite a few of my shaders have simply.. stopped working? (The ones that handle vertex displacement) Not sure what that is about, but without it, no foliage, or tree can move - need to look further into it.

Waterfall (no, no hidden cave behind it ...yet)

Not so happy with how this looks from this side, needs tweeking

The main road leading into the cabin/housing area - this bridge will be busted up due to an accident, making the player need to take the journey through the forest path, and not simply drive up.
